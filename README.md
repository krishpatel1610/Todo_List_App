# Full-Stack To-Do List Application

Created a to-do list application using React for the front end and Node.js with MongoDB for the back end. This project was developed as part of the pre-screening process for a full-stack developer position, showcasing my skills in both front-end and back-end development.

## Setup Instructions
### Front-End (React)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishpatel1610/Todo_List_App.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```


    ### Back-End (Node.js)
1.Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishpatel1610/Todo_List_App.git
   ```
2. Navigate to backend branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout backend
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```


## Tools and Libraries Used
### Front-End:
- **React**
- **React Router**
- **Axios (for API calls)**
- **CSS/SCSS for styling**

### Back-End:
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **Mongoose**

## Challenges Faced and Decisions Made

- **Challenge**: Ensuring proper error handling for API requests to improve user experience.


- **Decision**: Implemented centralized error handling in the back end to provide meaningful feedback for failed requests.
- **Challenge**: Maintaining responsive design across various devices.

- **Decision**: Utilized CSS Flexbox and media queries to create a fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
